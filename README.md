Digital Mishnah
===============

The Digital Mishnah Project aims to create a digital critical edition of the
Mishnah. This will involve transcribing and encoding major (ideally all)
manuscript witnesses to the text of the Mishnah, as well as citations in
medieval and early modern commentaries. The project is in its initial phases
and is using Bava Metsia Ch. 2 to develop a proof of concept. The goals for
this proof of concept are to:

* Provide digital renditions of manuscript witnesses
* Ability to show witnesses synoptically
* Ability to provide computer-processed collation of variants
* Statistical tools for measuring proximity or distance of witnesses

(Note that the `data/derivative` directory is only included for the sake of
convenience for transcribers who are not using Roma. Please do not edit these
files directly.)

The following commands will build the web application and run it in Jetty:

    cd cocoon/
    mvn validate
    mvn install
    cd viewer
    mvn jetty:run

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8888/text/`. You can
also build a `war` file that can be run in any servlet container by entering
the following:

    cd cocoon/
    mvn install
    mvn package

The file will be created in `cocoon/viewer/target/`.
